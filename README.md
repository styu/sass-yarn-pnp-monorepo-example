# sass-yarn-pnp-monorepo-example

This is a sample repo set up with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/), [Yarn PnP](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp), and [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs). It's meant to be a working example for how to compile typesafe SCSS modules in a monorepo, using the [postcss-typesafe-css-modules](https://github.com/styu/postcss-typesafe-css-modules/tree/main) PostCSS plugin. It's also an example of how to get Sass `@use` and `@import` statements working in a Yarn PnP monorepo, since that's not natively supported in Sass.
